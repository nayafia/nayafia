I spent a bunch of time writing about open source developers:
* [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) (Stripe Press): How modern open source works and drawing parallels to the creator economy
* [Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/): Open source code as a form of public infrastructure that requires maintenance
* Some of the repos you'll see here ([lemonade-stand](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand), [awesome-maintainers](https://github.com/nayafia/awesome-maintainers), [contributing-template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template), [opensource.guide](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide))
* [More stuff](https://nadia.xyz/), if you're into it
